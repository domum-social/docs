## Is this site for you?

Our secured server don't collect any personally identifiable data but that's only
half the story.  What you post, when you post, and how you post can
all leak hints about who you are.

As we build our library we will have more guidance on advanced use but
for now --- unless you are already a privacy expert --- we only recommend
low risk use, where being identified would be embarrassing but not
dangerous

We want all voices to be heard but safety comes first. As our learning
library grows we will expand our recommended use. Learn more about [our vision](/about/vision/) and why we built Domum Social.

## Get TorBrowser

Download and install the
[TorBrowser](https://www.torproject.org/download/?target=_blank) 
versions are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Android. 

For iOS get the  [Onion Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) app from the Apple App Store. 


Yup, it's that simple, click to install no fancy setup required.

## Go to our .onion site

Launch the browser you just installed.

Go to https://domum.social and click on the [![Tor Browser button icon - Click to access Domum Social via anonymous Tor network](join_login_tor.png?height=2em&classes=inline&border=false "Requires Tor Browser")](http://f3rz5puehnq7dfqqwajxu3izuovb6wqepof3prqesle76qyfivlfxgyd.onion)
button. This is at the bottom of the mobile site and in the right column on the desktop site.

## That's it

You should see `http://f3rz5puehnq7dfqqwajxu3izuovb6wqepof3prqesle76qyfivlfxgyd.onion` in the location bar of your browser. You are now browsing anonymously.

We'll have more articles soon on what Tor is and some simple examples
of how to use it. The [Tor Project
Documentation](https://support.torproject.org/about-tor/?target=_blank)
is quite extensive and their information on [understanding onion
addresses](https://support.torproject.org/about-tor/onion-services/what-is-a-dot-onion/?target=_blank)
explains why the URL above is so ugly and why it is secure even though it uses http and not https (it uses different encryption)
