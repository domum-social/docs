## Is this site for you?

Securing the server so we have no personally identifiable data is only
half the story.  What you post, when you post, and how you post can
all leak hints about who you are.

As we build out our library we will have more guidance on more
advanced use cases but for now unless you are already a privacy expert
we only recommend the site for low risk use where being identified
would be embarrassing, not dangerous.

We want all voices to be heard but safety comes first. As our learning
library grows we will expand our recommended use.

## Get TorBrowser

Download and install the [TorBrowser](https://www.torproject.org/download/?target=_blank)

## Go to our .onion site

Launch the [TorBrowser](https://www.torproject.org/download/?target=_blank) you just
installed.

Navigate to https://domum.social and click on the [![tor button](join_login_tor.png?height=2em&classes=inline&border=false "Requires Tor Browser")](http://f3rz5puehnq7dfqqwajxu3izuovb6wqepof3prqesle76qyfivlfxgyd.onion)
button. This is at the bottom of the mobile site and in the right column on the desktop site.

## That's it

You should see `http://f3rz5puehnq7dfqqwajxu3izuovb6wqepof3prqesle76qyfivlfxgyd.onion` in the location bar of your browser. You are now browsing anonymously.

We'll have more articles soon on what Tor is and how to use it in simple terms. The [Tor Project Documentation](https://support.torproject.org/about-tor/?target=_blank) is quite extensive and their information on [understanding onion addresses](https://support.torproject.org/about-tor/onion-services/what-is-a-dot-onion/?target=_blank) explains why that URL is so ugly and why it is secure even though it uses http and not https (in short it uses different encryption)
