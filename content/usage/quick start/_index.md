## Is this site for you

Securing the server so we have no personally identifiable data is only
half the story.  What you post, when you post, and how you post can
all leak hints about who you are.

As we build out our library we will have more guidance on more
advanced use cases but for now unless you are already a privacy expert
we only recommend the site for low risk use where being identified
would be embarrassing not dangerous.

We want all voices to be heard but safety comes first. As our learning
library grows we will expand our recommended use.
