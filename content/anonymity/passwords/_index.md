## Password Managers

Password managers are fantastic and you should definitely be using one
for most of you internet password needs.

They securely store all you passwords and generate unique and secure
passwords so they won't be guessed and if one does leak it doesn't
compromise all your other accounts.

The [Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF)](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-the-password-manager-that-s-right-for-you)
has an in-depth guide on what to consider in a password manager and a
web search will provide many options and comparisons.

If you want to maintain anonymity from people with access to your
devices such as room mates, family members, law enforcement, border
agents or malicious software, most password managers don't hide which
accounts you have only the login details.

Knowing that you have an account on a certain system is a big piece of
information that can lead to your account being identified.

For this reason we recommend that you *do* use a password manager but
that you *do not* name the account "Domum Social" or anything
related. Look around you now, pick any thing you see and add ".com",
use that instead.

We also recommend you store the password but not you username. Since
your username is publicly visible that is a lot more revealing than a
bare password if you are observed using the password manager.

Of course if you are not worried about this sort of attack you can go
ahead and use your password manager normally.

## Memorable but Secure Passwords

If you want a memorable but secure password, either to avoid putting a
super secret account in your password or as the password to you r
password manager itself you can't beat
[Diceware](https://diceware.dmuth.org/).

This uses dice to select a random set of words.  Since they are words
they're easy to remember, but once you get to a five or six word
passphrase they're incredibly strong.

If you choose this route you should physically write down the password
in a secure location or two so you don't loose it.  At the very least
carry it in you wallet on a piece of paper until you can type it
automatically without thinking.

If you frequently use the password it's likely to stay fresh in your
mind, but if you go for a while without using it you're much more
likely to forget. Do consider a keeping a physical backup of the
password or commit to logging in every day or two to stay in
practice.
