Monero, unlike most crypto currency, is anonymous by design.  Only
parties to a transaction can see what addresses are involved. **If you
are self hosting your wallet**

If you are using a hosted wallet, such as on an exchange platform,
they will keep records of all transactions.  This isn't as public as
most crypto where anyone can inspect all transactions and accounts,
but it is also not private.

Bitcoin is traceable by design. Despite what you may have heard it is
very far from anonymous. All transactions on the Bitcoin block chain
are publicly visible (by address) this is how most crypo works.

## A note on economics

You will often hear discussion of the cost per user or active monthly
user when people talk about running various social media
platforms. This is convenient but it is misleading.

The major cost of social platforms is serving the data to **readers**
not storing creators' content. That's not free either but in most cases
it is substantially less.

This is why the big commercial platforms are advertising based.  That
revenue stream is based on the number of consumers not creators and
scales with costs.

If you enjoy what you see here show your appreciation.

If you're a creator encourage your followers to contribute.

## Other funding methods
{{% notice style="secondary" icon="hand" title="Privacy warning"  %}}
It's very important to keep funding and accounts separate to preserve user anonymity. Please *do not use your @domum.social account* to ask about funding options you plan to use yourself as most payment systems --- including crypto currency --- are traceable by design.
