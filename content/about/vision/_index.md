Domum Social is about having the anonymity to say unsafe things safely.

As our social space becomes more polarised and divisive there's an understandable tendency to retreat to comfortable spaces or worse to stop talking at all for fear of reprisal.

Through strong anonymity, active moderation and clear simple documentation about both how to preserve your anonymity while posting and how to evaluate anonymous claims we hope to break through the walls of our internet echo chambers and rehumanize our neighbors.

This starts with our Mastodon instance [Domum.Social](https://domum.social) like most Mastodon instances [Domum.Social](https://domum.social) is part of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) which allows a broad spectrum of public interaction.  Unlike any other [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) service we are aware of [Domum.Social](https://domum.social) only allows sign ups and logins from the anonymous [Tor Network](https://www.torproject.org/).

Don't worry if that seems overly complicated, it really doesn't have to be.  Before we open to the public we'll have simple easy to follow instructions that will get you on board in no time.

This design lets anyone in the  [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) easily and naturally interact with your posts but prevents us from ever seeing where you are really posting from.  We can't give away what we don't have, and the only  thing we have is your public posts...

This service was the initial thought behind  [Domum.Social](https://domum.social) but we quickly realized server security is really only part of the puzzle.  It's obvious that if you post a picture of your self holding your passport and driver's license while standing in front of your house that will somewhat degrade the anonymity of your account.  So before we open for general use we want to have a decent library of documentation that puts in simple terms how concerned you should be about your anonymity depending on your situation and what you should and shouldn't do to protect yourself at an appropriate level.
